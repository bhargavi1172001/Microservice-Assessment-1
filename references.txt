This project was developed as part of a technical assessment for the Microservice-based AI Detection Service. 
The solution consists of two major components:
1. AI-Service: A Flask-based microservice that performs object detection using the YOLO11x model.
2. UI-Service: A simple user interface module to interact with the detection API.

Development Environment:
- Python 3.12 (Virtual Environment)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- YOLO11x pretrained weights (Ultralytics)
- Docker for containerized deployment
- Postman / cURL for endpoint testing

Acknowledgement:
The project leverages the YOLO11x model from Ultralytics for accurate object detection and bounding box generation. 
All implementation, API design, and integration steps were independently executed using official documentation and 
trusted open-source resources. The results include output images with bounding boxes and corresponding JSON files 
for detected objects.
